# Open Voice Activity Detection

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is one of the first and most important steps an app with speech recognition has to perform. And yet, in researching real-time voice chat agents, I discovered that SoTA models are not truely open-source, only "open-weights." This poses challenges for researching and improving the SoTA in VAD.

In this repo, I plan to include:

* a full implementation of Silero VAD for research purposes
* code to train Silero VAD from scratch on custom data
* evaluations on common benchmarks
* LoRA fine-tuning for Silero VAD
* example integrations with Python, client-side web apps, and Unity

# Fully Open-Source Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for Real-Time Speech Applications
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a critical first step in any application involving speech recognition. However, while exploring real-time voice chat agents, I found that many state-of-the-art (SoTA) models are not truly open-sourceâ€”they provide only open weights, limiting transparency and hindering research and development.

This repository aims to change that by providing a fully open and research-friendly implementation of the Silero VAD model. The goal is to advance the state of the art in VAD through open experimentation, training, and integration.

## Status
As of May 27, 2025, this repository includes:
âœ… A complete implementation of the Silero VAD model for research use

## Roadmap
In the near future, I plan to add the following:
ðŸ§  Code to train Silero VAD from scratch on custom datasets

ðŸ“Š Evaluation scripts for standard VAD benchmarks

ðŸ”§ Support for LoRA fine-tuning to extend or adapt Silero VAD

ðŸ”Œ Example integrations with Python, client-side web applications, and Unity
