# Fully Open-Source Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for Real-Time Speech Applications
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a critical first step in any application involving speech recognition. However, while exploring real-time voice chat agents, I found that many state-of-the-art (SoTA) models are not truly open-sourceâ€”they provide only open weights, limiting transparency and hindering research and development.

This repository aims to change that by providing a fully open and research-friendly implementation of the Silero VAD model. The goal is to advance the state of the art in VAD through open experimentation, training, and integration.

## Status
As of May 27, 2025, this repository includes:
âœ… A complete implementation of the Silero VAD model for research use

## Roadmap
In the near future, I plan to add the following:
ðŸ§  Code to train Silero VAD from scratch on custom datasets

ðŸ“Š Evaluation scripts for standard VAD benchmarks

ðŸ”§ Support for LoRA fine-tuning to extend or adapt Silero VAD

ðŸ”Œ Example integrations with Python, client-side web applications, and Unity
