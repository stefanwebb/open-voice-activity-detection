# Open Voice Activity Detection

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is one of the first and most important steps an app with speech recognition has to perform. And yet, in researching real-time voice chat agents, I discovered that SoTA models are not truely open-source, only "open-weights." This poses challenges for researching and improving the SoTA in VAD.

In this repo, I plan to include:

* a full implementation of Silero VAD for research purposes
* code to train Silero VAD from scratch on custom data
* evaluations on common benchmarks
* LoRA fine-tuning for Silero VAD
* example integrations with Python, client-side web apps, and Unity
